Try it on Hugging Face now! [![Hugging Face](https://img.shields.io/badge/Demo-%F0%9F%A4%97%20Hugging%20Face-blue)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/cxumol/CoverPilot)

## Setup

#### Prepare API for AI capabilities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to bring your own API keys.  
> If you have no idea about it, try getting one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

The API base defaults to OpenAI's, and compatible with AI service providers who have the same API structure.

Once you obtained can set API configurations in 2 ways:
- environment variables
- AI Setup panel on the Web UI

Check out the [config.py](app/config.py) for more details.

#### Deploy on Hugging Face

#### Run on local

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cxumol/CoverPilot.git && cd CoverPilot
pip install -r requirements.txt
