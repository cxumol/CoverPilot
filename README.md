## Workflow

With powerful Prompt Engineering, CoverPilot can deeply understand your resume and the job description, and find the best writing style to match your experience with the job. 

In CoverPilot, we hire two AI agents cooperatively writing your cover letter:

- **CheapAI**, an honest format converter and refiner, extracts essential info from job description and rÃ©sumÃ©.
- **StrongAI**, a thoughtful wordsmith, composes perfect cover letters to make both you and recruiters happy.

> Thanks to **CheapAI**'s work, your spending on **StrongAI** is substaintially saved.

## Setup

### Prepare API for AI capabilities

> [!IMPORTANT]
> You have to bring your own API keys.  
> If you have no idea about it, try getting one from https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys

The API base defaults to OpenAI's, and compatible with AI service providers who have the same API structure.

Once you obtained can set API configurations in 2 ways:
- environment variables
- AI Setup panel on the Web UI

Check out the [config.py](app/config.py) for more details.
